The Claiming Heads Spell Pack is a Wizards of Lua add-on that adds claiming support to Minecraft worlds.

<!--more-->

The intention of this spell pack is to support server owners who want to host "mostly vanilla" survival servers but also want to restrict griefing. This spell pack provides a spell that protects certain areas - called claims - so that only the players who own this area are allowed to build there. This is done by changing the game mode of any unauthorized player from "survial" to "adventure" when he or she enters a protected area. An area can be claimed by placing a "claiming head" in the middle of it.

Multi-owner claims are supported. Claiming heads can be created by command.

See the [project homepage](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/claiming-heads) for more information.
